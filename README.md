Google Form -> Email and Calendar
---------------------------------


**Description**

A script for when a Google Form is submitted, it sends out email(s) and creates a google Calendar event and invites who you emailed. 


**How it works**

The spreadsheet of the Google Form has a trigger that collects the data needed for the event, then creates a calendar event, invites members and then sends an email with the information.
